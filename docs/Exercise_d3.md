## Exercise 3:  Make your Classic App available in Lightning & Explore Lightning Experience


Lightning is enabled in your environment!  Time to make your custom app, Dreamhouse Classic, available to your Lightning users.  If you are just getting started with Lightning and want to explore what your Classic App will look like, we will do this with just a few clicks. However, while this is a fast and easy way to make your Classic App visible in Lightning, it will still have some limitations. Later on we will finish our Lightning migration by creating a brand new Lightning App for Dreamhouse. 

1. First, switch to Lightning Experience for yourself so you can start exploring and building.
    1. Your profile drop down at top right of page | **Switch to Lightning Experience**
2. Make your classic app visible in Lightning and add some additional tabs. 
    1. All Setup | Apps | App Manager | **Dreamhouse Classic** | Edit | Select the “Show in Lightning Experience” Checkbox.
    2. In the Choose the Tabs box, select the **Chatter**, **Reports** & **Dashboards** tabs and move to the Selected Tabs box. 
    3. Save.


Now with just a few clicks you have made your Classic App visible in Lightning, let's take a look at what this app looks like in Lightning and explore some of the end user features in Lighting Experience. 

1. Navigate to your Classic App in Lightning using the App Launcher
    1. App Launcher | Dreamhouse Classic 
2. Now that we are in the Lightning view for the Dreamhouse Classic App, lets get oriented to the new experience and navigation, starting with Chatter. 
    1. Chatter Tab
    2. Click on Company Highlights. Company Highlights will show trending, new and popular posts from across your organization even if you are not following the related records. 
    3. Chatter Streams. Chatter Streams is where your users can create curated lists of records and people to follow
        1. Chatter Streams | + | Add a few records and Users to your new chatter stream | Name your Chatter stream and  Save. 
3. Lightning has expanded Search functionality. Let's explore Global Search 
    1. Click Search Bar. In Lightning your recent items will now be accessible in a drop down from your global search bar. 
    2. Type “leads”.  You will see now see the option to Search the string “leads”, search within the tab you are currently on(Chatter), or to define your search to the Leads object. 
    3. Select **Limit search to Leads**. This limits your search to within the Leads object. Now type “Laura” and hit enter. 
    4. Click on the resulting Search Record, **Laura Croft**
4. If you’re familiar with customizing tab sets in Salesforce Classic, you’ll like the way you can personalize your   navigation with favorites. Favorites let you quickly access important records, lists, groups, dashboards, and other frequently used pages in Salesforce. They’re similar to bookmarks in a web browser but better because your favorites are available no matter which browser or computer you use to log into Lightning Experience.
    1. While viewing the Lead record for Laura Croft **Select the star in the upper right of your Lightning view** to add the current record to your favorites list.
    2. You can manage Favorites right from the Favorites menu. Select the Favorites star to view your favorites, and click **Edit Favorites** to rename, reorder, or remove Favorited items. 
    3. Select **Done**.
5. The Navigation bar and List Views in Lightning have new features to explore as well
    1. Select the **V** on the Properties tab. On the drop down you now can create new records, view favorites for this object, or select a list view. 
    2. Click on **Top Listings** List View
    3. Edit some property records from your list view, you can also try editing list view records without your mouse using your arrow keys + Enter.
    4. In Lightning, your users also have new ways to access records and visualize the records in a List View. Let's take a look. 
        1. Chart Icon | New Chart | Create a new chart for your list view, make the values whatever you would like
        2. Select Display As: KanBan View | KanBan Settings | Price & Status | Save 
6. In Lightning you can create a Calendar from any list view of a record with  Date fields, so lets see how we can create a Calendar of our top property listing dates. 
    1. App Launcher | Calendar Tab (This can be found in the **All Items** area below the Lightning Apps in your App Launcher or by searching in the App Launcher search window)
    2. Select the Gear Icon next to “My Calendars” for **New Calendar **
        1. Object: Property 
        2. Next 
        3. Calendar Name: Top Listings 
        4. Field for Start: Date Listed
        5. Field for end: None
        6. Apply a Filter: Top Listings
        7. Field Name to Display: Property Name
        8. Save
    3. Select Options arrow for your new **Top Listings** Calendar and select a new custom color from the palette 
    4. In the top right of your calendar tab, change the Calendar date range view from Week to  **Month**
    5. Favorite this tab.
